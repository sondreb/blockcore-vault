# Blockcore Vault

Blockcore is commited to support the Confidential Storage W3C specification by the Identity Foundation.

Specification draft: https://identity.foundation/confidential-storage/

This is our work-in-progress to implement the standards for decentralized identity storage.

While we are commited to supporting the standard, our initial release of the software will use custom authentication and unencrypted storage.

## Development Plans

The initial version of the Blockcore Vault will be a basic unencrypted storage API that can be utilize by apps to store user's data.

The Vault will be able to do Vault-to-Vault data syncronization to ensure decentralized storage of data.

Future updates will add the confidential storage capabilities with encrypted storage.
